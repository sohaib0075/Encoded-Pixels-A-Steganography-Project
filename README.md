# Encoded-Pixels-A-Steganography-Project

This project implements a complete steganography system from scratch in Python, allowing secure hiding and extraction of both text and images within images. It features a menu-driven interface for ease of navigation and demonstration. The system begins by hiding text in a selfie image using the least significant bit (LSB) technique, where the last 1 or 2 bits of each pixel channel are modifiedâ€”1 bit ensures minimal distortion, while 2 bits offer greater capacity. Both original and modified images are displayed, and hidden messages are accurately extracted. In the second module, the user inputs any image and custom message, which is embedded and later retrieved to validate the encoding-decoding process. The third module hides a complete image inside another using the last 2 bits of the cover image, enabling effective concealment with minimal quality loss. A real demonstration is provided using a selfie as the cover and an AI-generated secret image. The fourth module performs image superimposition using 4 bits from each of two bright, contrasting images, ensuring one image dominates visually while the other remains subtly hidden. This project highlights the power of steganography for secure communication and demonstrates bit-level manipulation, image processing, and visual cryptography techniques using only fundamental Python and OpenCV.
